# Description:

This is an OpenSCAD model for a simple SMA nut finger-wrench that
can be printed in a few minutes on a 3D printer.

The included scad file is optimized for a Monoprice Select Mini 3D
printer.  For other printers, you may need to modify the "HexWidth"
dimension in the SMASpinner.scad file.

The default model produces a wrench with a cutout large enough
to slip over UT-141 semirigid coax.
